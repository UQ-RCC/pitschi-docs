## 1. Once logged in, the "Start new experiment" is greyed out. Is it normal ?

It means there is a mitmatch between your email address in PPMS and AAF (many IMB users face this problem). Please drop me an email (pitschi at uq.edu.au) to deal with this problem. 

## 2. I have dropped few folders inside X:\pitschi\\_my_username_, but they are not all synced. 

Assuming you have created an experiment called "firstexperiment", Pitschi only syncs the data inside X:\pitschi\\_my_username_\firstexperiment. 

## 3. My experiment is paused, what do I do ?

The experiment is paused most likely due to the fact that the X drive is full. Before pausing the experiment, Pitschi has notified admin. If you still worry, please contact Lou.


## 4. When should I start the experiment ?

You should start the experiment right before you start collecting data.

## 5. Do I have to stop my experiment ? 

Yes

## 6. What if I forgot to stop my experiment ? 

The next user cannot start another experiment if the previous one forgot to stop it. Only admins (Lou, Matthias and myself) could stop other people's experiments.

## 7. Why doesn't my project appear in the selection list when I try to start a new experiment ?

Ask the Pitschi support team to check that your project collection is mounted
in the required institute access cache, and that the required cache is
configured in the Pitschi datamover and the Pitschi XAPI server.

## 8. Why is the _Start a new experiment_ button disabled when I login ?

This usually means your email address in RIMS or in AAF is different to your
email in Pitschi datamover. View your [RIMS profile](https://rims.uq.edu.au/userprofile/)
to check your **Email** in RIMS. Use the [AAF Validator](https://validator.aaf.edu.au/)
to check your **mail** attribute in AAF. Contact
[Pitschi support](mailto:pitschi@uq.edu.au) for advice on fixing different
emails, or to check your email setting in Pitschi datamover.
