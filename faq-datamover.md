## 1. Once logged in, the "Start new experiment" is greyed out. Is it normal ?

It means there is a mitmatch between your email address in PPMS and AAF (many IMB users face this problem). Please drop me an email (pitschi at uq.edu.au) to deal with this problem. 

## 2. I have dropped few folders inside X:\pitschi\\_my_username_, but they are not all synced. 

Assuming you have created an experiment called "firstexperiment", Pitschi only syncs the data inside X:\pitschi\\_my_username_\firstexperiment. 

## 3. My experiment is paused, what do I do ?

The experiment is paused most likely due to the fact that the X drive is full. Before pausing the experiment, Pitschi has notified admin. If you still worry, please contact Lou.
