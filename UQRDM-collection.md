## How do I link/create an UQRDM collection for my project?

### Option 1: If you have an existing UQRDM collection (Q-collection)

You can use it for your CMM project only if:

- It is linked to your CMM project registered in [RIMS](https://rims.uq.edu.au/login/?pf=2).
- It is mountable to HPCs at UQ (so-called Q-collection).

- Add pitschi@uq.edu.au as a collaborator in the Q-collection.
- Please send the **UQRDM collection ID** to cmm-support@uq.edu.au.
