## What is PITSCHI?

**Particle Imaging depoT using Storage caCHing Infrastructure (PITSCHI)** is a data repository for the Centre for Microscopy and Microanalysis developed and established with UQ’s partner RCC and digital services. We plan to roll out PITSCHI on all CMM data acquisition instruments. The benefit for users is your data will be copied and hosted in your “own research RDM”. So there won’t be any worries of data transfer/loss etc. An 8-month test phase has proven its functionality and ease of use.

## How to use PITSCHI?
To use PITSCHI workflow, each user needs to set up a project [UQRDM](https://research.uq.edu.au/rmbt/uqrdm) collection (new or existing) to save data in your project RDM collections directly from the instrument. PITSCHI will offer, once data and metadata are transferred and extracted, to use a Web browser to navigate through your experiments and datasets, and it allows you to start data/image processing software on our high-performance computing (HPC) clusters directly out of PITSCHI. Over the years, we will enrich your datasets with more metadata, which is your research and UQ's asset.
## PITSCHI Training:

### PITSCHI: A FAIR dataset management solution for CMM scientific instruments

Please [register](https://cmm.centre.uq.edu.au/pitschi) to attend **PITSCHI HOUR/FAIR Datahandling**. Join us to learn about scientific data management, [FAIR](https://ardc.edu.au/resource/fair-policy-for-ardc-and-ardc-co-investment-project-materials/) principles, and your data handling at the [Centre for Microscopy and Microanalysis (CMM)](https://cmm.centre.uq.edu.au/) at [The University of Queensland](https://www.uq.edu.au/). The weekly event helps connect the dots between the research data life cycle from your research and data generated at CMM and how to use PITSCHI in your workflow i.e. how to save data directly in your or your group’s project RDM collections from CMM instruments. We’ll address any questions and/or help you integrate your UQRDM collections with PITSCHI.
