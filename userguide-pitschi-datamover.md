<!-- Pitschi datamover is a Web service in charge of syncing data from the instrument computer to the project's RDM collection via an intermediate computer (support machines or preprocessing machines). This guide is to show the steps to register your project with Pitschi and how Pitschi datamover is used. -->


# 1. Setup


<span style="color:red">Please note that this setup process takes time as some steps need to be done by other UQ IT personnels </span>

1. First you need to make sure you have an account, and an active project in PPMS
2. Second you need to make sure you have an existing RDM for your project. If you do not have a RDM, please request one at (https://rdm.uq.edu.au/). Please make sure you tick the option "**The project data needs to be mounted on UQ HPC facilities**"
3. Make sure you add Pitschi (pitschi@uq.edu.au) as a collaborator to your project RDM. 
4. **Fill up** the email template [here](mailto:pitschi@uq.edu.au?&subject=Pitschi%20datamover%20setup&body=To%20whom%20it%20may%20concern%2C%20%0A%0ACould%20you%20please%20help%20me%20with%20setting%20up%20Pitschi.%0A%0A%20%20%20%20Instrument%20name%3A%20%0A%20%20%20%20My%20PPMS%20project%20is%3A%20%0A%20%20%20%20My%20project%20RDM%20is%3A%20%0A%20%20%20%20Are%20you%20going%20to%20use%20CVL%40Wiener%20for%20processing%20%3F%20%5BYes%2FNo%5D%20%0A%0A%20Regards) **with your own details**.

5) Once the experiment is started, it will show where you should drop the data from the camera machine. Pitschi will sync the data from there to your RDM periodically. The synced files and folders are to be displayed at the bottom of the page (You need to expand the folder icon).

6) Once you finish collecting data, you can stop the experiment. If you choose to delete the source data, it will be deleted **if and only if your data has been synced successfully to your RDM**.
