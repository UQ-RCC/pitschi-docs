Pitschi (Particle Imaging depoT using Storage caCHing Infrastructure) is a data repository that is built on top of [Clowder data management framework](https://github.com/clowder-framework/). 

Pitschi aims to:
* provide an end-to-end process: from capturing, transferring raw data to storage collections and indexing the data
* use one storage collection per project
* harvest as much metadata as possible
* provide simple ways for users to deposit data

Pitschi is quite unique in that:
* It is integrated with the [PPMS booking system](https://www.stratocore.com/) 
* It is integrated with the [UQ RDM](https://research.uq.edu.au/rmbt/uqrdm) for data movement and ingestion.
